# On-orbit demonstration plan

1. SCRAP token verification (1-hop):
    - Token issued by operator using their AES key, or a key "blessed" by their AES key
    - Token verified by scrap-core on-orbit
    - PTLC Response token generated
    - Transmit PTLC token to operator
    - Operator unlocks payment on Testnet using token
        - scrap-issuer software, not written yet

2. Multi-hop
    - TWO devices both running scrap-core with different operators
    - Dyson assembles 2-hop task packet
    - Demonstrate decrypting our payload, forwarding to second hop
    - 1st hop PTLC token generated
    - 2nd hop PTLC token generated
    - Both hops get their PTLC token to the ground
        - Both operators running scrap-issuer, unlock payment on testnet

3. Round trip with data relay and results delivery
    - THREE or more devices all running scrap core with different operators
    - All tokens generated by operators running scrap-issuer
    - Each unlocks their task and relays
    - Each gets their PTLC token back to operator
    - Ground (Dyson) receives final payload and forwards to customer
