## The Opportunity

### Join as Co-Founder: Business & Operations Lead

**What we're building:**
Cryptographic authorization and payment infrastructure for autonomous satellite operations

**Why now:**
- 10,000+ satellites launching in the next 5 years
- No standard for cross-operator coordination
- Ground station bottleneck creates latency (hours, not minutes)

**Your role:**
- Own business development, government contracting, and fundraising
- Lead SDVOSB certification (5% federal goal = ~$30B/year target)
- Build relationships with DoD, NASA, and commercial operators

### Why This Matters

| Current State | With SCRAP |
|---------------|-----------|
| 47-minute ground station wait | Minutes via inter-satellite link |
| Manual operator coordination | Cryptographic authorization |
| Trust-based payments | Atomic settlement (pay only if delivered) |
| Single-operator only | Cross-constellation coordination |

> *First-mover advantage in defining the standard for inter-satellite commerce*
