## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| CubeSat partner unavailable | Multiple partners; ground simulation fallback |
| Grant funding not secured | Diversify: NASA, DARPA, NSF |
| CCSDS adoption slow | Industry consortium as parallel path |
| ITU X-band denied | Ka-band fallback architecture |

**De-risking strategy:**

Phase 1 validates protocol before infrastructure investment.

Standards path via CCSDS provides legitimacy; consortium as backup.

Regulatory timeline known (WRC-27); fallback spectrum exists.
