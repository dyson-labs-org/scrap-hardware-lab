## Phase 1: CubeSat Demonstration

### Proving Protocol Correctness

**Platform:** Existing CubeSats with UHF ISL (435-438 MHz)

**What we demonstrate:**
- Capability token verification on-orbit
- Multi-hop task routing (2-3 satellites)
- Cryptographic proof of execution
- Atomic settlement

**UHF limitations:** 9.6 kbps — enough for tokens (~1KB) and signatures (64B), not imagery.

**What it proves:**
- Protocol works in space environment
- Multi-hop delegation chains function
- Settlement atomicity holds

**Timeline:** 12-18 months with grant funding
