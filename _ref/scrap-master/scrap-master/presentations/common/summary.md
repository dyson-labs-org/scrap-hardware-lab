## Why This Matters

### The Space Industry Needs This

**10,000+ satellites by 2030** — most unable to coordinate across operators

**Current state:**
- Every operator pair needs bilateral agreements
- Emergency response waits for ground passes
- No standard for cross-operator tasking

**With SCRAP:**
- Any satellite can request services from any operator
- Pre-authorized emergency response in minutes
- Cryptographic proof of execution
- Trustless settlement

**We're building the missing infrastructure layer.**
