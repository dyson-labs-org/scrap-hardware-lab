## The Problem

### Five Requirements That Current Systems Can't Meet

1. **Task Authorization** — Satellites must verify commands from authorized parties

2. **Cross-Operator Coordination** — Different operators' satellites must collaborate without shared infrastructure

3. **No Pre-Shared Secrets** — Satellites that have never communicated must authenticate

4. **Intermittent Connectivity** — ISL windows of 2-15 minutes every ~90 minutes

5. **Fair Exchange** — Services must be paid for, but only if actually delivered

**Today's reality:** A Coast Guard SAR request waits **47 minutes** for a ground station pass. Emergency response measured in hours, not minutes.
